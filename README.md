Recognition of Face and Facial Expressions using PCA, SVM and CNN

Facial recognition is a technology that is capable of recognizing a human face from a digital image or video frame. It employs machine learning algorithms which find, capture, store and analyze facial features in order to match them with images of individuals in a pre-existing database. Facial recognition plays a major role in the detection and prevention of crime, particularly identity theft. It also provides businesses a fast and accurate method of identifying individuals in a way that is less intrusive and requires no contact.

Facial expression recognition is a technology which uses biometric markers to detect emotions in human faces. This technology is a sentiment analysis tool and is able to automatically detect the six basic or universal expressions conveying nonverbal communication cues that play an important role in interpersonal relations.
